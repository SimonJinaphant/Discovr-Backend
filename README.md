# Discovr-Backend
Backend web service for [Discovr](https://github.com/SimonJinaphant/Discovr), a personalized UBC companion app.

### Background
The backend operates on Microsoft ASP.NET MVC with Web API framework, including EntityFramwork for ORM purposes.

### Setting up?
The backend is currently hosted on the team's Azure subscription, due to privacy reason the login credential cannot be shared publically, although you're free to contact me if you (the instructors) require it
